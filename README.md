# 🎮 Alternate Portfolios — Clash of Clans Universe

This project is part of **Alternate Portfolios**, a personal UI/UX design series where my real portfolio is reimagined through different design systems and visual languages.

Each project in the series explores a single question:

> *What if my portfolio existed in an alternate universe?*

This edition translates my portfolio into a **Clash of Clans–inspired interface**, using game UI metaphors such as cards, progression, upgrades, and quests — while still functioning as a real, usable portfolio.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This is a **single-page UI/UX portfolio website** designed as a **system**, not a collection of screens.

Instead of traditional sections, information is structured using familiar game mechanics:
- Skills are represented as upgradeable abilities
- Projects appear as completed battles or artifacts
- Experience and education follow a progression path
- Certifications are treated as achievements

The goal is not to recreate the game, but to **adapt proven game UI patterns into a professional web context**.

## 🎯 Why Clash of Clans?

Clash of Clans is a strong reference because it manages:
- High information density
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Immediate affordances
- Strong feedback loops

Despite being visually rich, its interface remains intuitive.  
This project uses that design philosophy as a **stress test for UX clarity on the web**.

## 🧩 Design Intent

This project was built to demonstrate:
- System-based design thinking
- Translation of non-web interfaces to web UX
- Visual hierarchy under heavy theming
- Interaction design beyond minimal SaaS patterns

It is intentionally **playful in presentation** but **structured in logic**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Next.js** — framework for performance and structure  
- **React** — component-driven UI  
- **CSS / Tailwind / Custom styling** — for detailed card-based visuals  
- **Game-inspired motion & interaction patterns**

> The focus of this project is UI/UX design and system thinking.  
> Code is used as a medium, not the final goal.

## 📚 Series Context

This project is **one universe** in the **Alternate Portfolios** series.

Planned / ongoing universes include:
- Clash of Clans (this project)
- Tetris (constraint-driven minimal system)
- Additional design systems explored through different metaphors

Each universe uses the **same core portfolio data**, reinterpreted through a different design lens.
